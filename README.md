## OVERVIEW

In this activity, using the MySQL and Inquirer Node Packages, I created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, I programmed this app to track product sales across the store's departments to provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


## SCREENSHOTS

1. Typical User Flow Screenshots
* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).

## Other Screenshots
* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
